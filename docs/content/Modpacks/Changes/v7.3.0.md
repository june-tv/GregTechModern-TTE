# Updating from `7.2.1` to `7.3.0`

## Diluted Sulfuric and Hydrochloric Acid
Previously, Distilling Diluted H2SO4 and HCl back into usable acid was done on Circuit 1 for H2SO4 but on Circuit 2 for
HCl. These have been unified to both use Circuit 1. This will (very mildly) break existing bases.

## Chance Logics

- `first` ChanceLogic has been Deprecated as its behavior is highly unreliable, and it will be fully removed in 8.0.0.
  We recommend using `xor` instead.
