# Updating from `7.2.0` to `7.2.1`

## AdjacentFluid() and AdjacentBlock()

For ease of use for KJS, we have added overrides for

- `adjacentFluid(ResourceLocation... tagNames)` -> `adjacentFluidTag(ResourceLocation... tagNames)`

and

- `adjacentFluid(Fluid... fluids)` -> `adjacentFluids(Fluid... fluids)`

This way, the old `AdjacentFluid(...)` methods still exist, but there also is a clear way to use the kubejs without ambiguous casts / methods.

These changes hold for the `.adjacentBlock()` too.
